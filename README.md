# Co-authorship-Network - Social Network Analysis with ERGM
### This document includes the analysis scripts for statistical modeling of co-authorship network data with Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGM) using ergm package in R.
### The result shows the attribute 'gender' of scholars in the co-authorship network does not have significant influence on the tendency for assortativity/homophily mixing in the formulation of their network.
### Limitation: ergm cannot deal with missing values.
